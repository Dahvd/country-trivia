# country-trivia
The beginning of many geography related trivia games starting with a flag guesser.

### Things to do:
- Narrow down by continent
- Port to web, check react-native-web vs just react
- Add multiplayer to compete with friends

### Things to fix:
- When guessing the country name is too long, the text changes the center spacing for the whole guessing page.
- Checkboxes and circle X are pushed out when the country name is too long on the display screen.

### Other ideas
- Country guesser, guess/click on country for a given name
- Timezone guesser
- Country top facts or info display page
- Possible real learning opportunities, look at what people need to know for school
